      <h2>General info</h2>
      <div><p>My name is Jack Jenkinson and I recently graduated at Manchester Univercity.
        After my time studying in Manchester I decided that I aslo wanted to work there. While 
        applying to many jobs I found an opportunity at The Hut Group (THG). The Hut Group offers an 
        accelorator program that can fast track graduates into software engineering roles so it
        looked great for me. I started work at THG on the 26th of september and have work there 
        since.

        <h2>Sixth form and Univercity</h2>
        <div><p> To study for my A-levels I attended Wyke sixth form collage in Hull. I did three 
          A-levels, Chemistry, Maths and Further maths. In 2019 I applied to 5 different Univercities
          but my first choice was Univercity of Manchester. Luckily I was accepted into the Univercity 
          and I started in September 2019.
